What we are trying to do? {style="color:black;"}
=========================

Summarize research papers by either extractive or abstractive methods to
capture important keypoints from them.

PROJECT PROPOSAL

The function of our tool is to summarize research papers by extracting
important sentences from them. The goal here is to find an automated way
of quantifying the significance of each sentence so that only most
significant sentences are present in the summarized version. The order
of sentences in summary needs to be sensible without loss of continuity.
We also intend to provide a downloadable PowerPoint of the summarized
version of research paper. The created summary would be such that it is
easier for people to understand the main idea and its usefulness will
find a middle ground between reading only the abstract and reading the
entire research paper.

ISSUES TO ADDRESS

No Ground Truth Summaries for Research papers

Research Papers are Lengthy

Research papers are of different lengths

Proper Transfer Learning

Mathematical Formulas, Images and other unstructured data
